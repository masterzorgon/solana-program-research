# blockchain-research
This was developed by [Nathan Galindo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-galindo/) as part of an academic research project at Baylor University which lookes into how NFT technology can enhance financial services, such as invoicing.

## How it Works
The project uses smart contracts to create unique NFTs for each invoice. These NFTs represent the invoice and contain all necessary information such as the amount due, due date, and payment details. The NFTs can be easily transferred between parties and tracked on the Solana blockchain, providing a transparent and secure way of handling invoicing.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have the following software installed:
* Solana command-line tools
* Rust programming language
* Node
* Yarn
* Cargo
* Anchor
* TypeScript
* Git

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/nathanzebedee/blockchain-research/
cd blockchain-research
anchor build
cd /app
yarn 
yarn dev
```

## Usage
To use the project, simply create a new invoice by interacting with the smart contract. This will create a new NFT representing the invoice. The NFT can then be transferred to the appropriate parties and tracked on the Solana blockchain.
